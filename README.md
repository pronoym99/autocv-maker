# autoCVmkr
With just a few lines of LaTeX code, you can quickly create a visually appealing and well-formatted CV that highlights your work experience, education, skills, and other relevant information.
It has used GitHub action that complies the `*.tex` file and publishes a new PDF version when new changes are pushed to the repo

## Overleaf
This template is also available on OverLeaf. You can follow this link to use this CV template on Overleaf - https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/autocvmkr-cv-template/qqgywjpfdjwj


## Quickstart
- Fork this repo (you can use the `Use this template` button)
- Modify the `cv.tex` file and push changes to your repo
- The complied PDF will be available under the `build` branch

Optionally, while forking this repo, you can get a direct link to the generated PDF which you can use on your website, LinkedIn etc. that will always point to the latest version of your CV. For this, after editing your copy of `cv.tex` and pushing changes to your repo, under Settings -> Pages set your Github Pages source to the `build` directory
